## LaserDefender 2D Game from the 2D Game Development Course
In the last part of the 2D Game Development Course from GameDevTV I created a game that is themathically and mechanically similar to the old-school Space Invaders. 
The goal for the player is simple. Destroy the enemy ships that appear and avoid getting destroyed by them.
The enemies get spawned at waves which are stored as ScriptableObjects in the project and cotain all the necessarry information about the wave(type of enemy that will get spawned, tha path that those enemies are going to follow,
the time between each enemy spawn and the movement speed of the enemies). 
The gameplay experience was further improved by adding particle effects, camera shake(when the player receives a hit) and music and SFX.
